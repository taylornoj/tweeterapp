# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone that uses HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery, AJAX, as well as Node and Express.  This project is from Lighthouse Labs, designed to help students get comfortable with their front-end skills.

## Welcome to Tweeter!

With Tweeter, users can enjoy a responsive design technology so that their Tweeter page looks great on larger desktops or smaller screens.



Whether you're feeling shy or have too much on your mind, Tweeter will remind you that each 'hum' has a character requirement.  Don't worry - we'll keep count as you type!  Once you enter a valid tweet, it will be posted immediately and that error will disappear!



Each new tweet will be added to the top of the Tweeter stack so you can keep up to date on the most recent events!  Hover over a tweet to create a dynamic shadow and watch the flag, retweeter and like icons change colour!
